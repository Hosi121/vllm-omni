"""Which interpreter runs a stage worker, and why one is missing.

Four routes reach the two AMD devices on this laptop, and no two of them can
share an interpreter:

==============  ==========================  ====================================
route           interpreter                 why it is separate
==============  ==========================  ====================================
``ort-vitisai`` native Windows, plain ORT   the NPU is an MCDM device; WSL's
                >= 1.25                     GPU-PV forwards WDDM adapters only,
                                            so ``/dev/accel`` does not exist
``ort-dml``     native Windows,             ``onnxruntime-directml`` is pinned
                onnxruntime-directml        at 1.24.4 and cannot load the
                                            VitisAI EP, which needs >= 1.25
``torch-dml``   WSL, ``.venvs/dml``         ``torch-directml`` pins torch 2.4.1;
                                            Omni runs 2.13
``ort-cpu``     anything with onnxruntime   the reference arm, and what the
                                            tests use on a machine with no AMD
                                            hardware
==============  ==========================  ====================================

Every lookup returns a :class:`Route` either way. A missing interpreter is a
first-class answer with a ``reason`` a person can act on, not an exception and
not silence: "the NPU is unusable" and "the NPU venv is not installed" lead to
different work, and the planner has to be able to tell the caller which it hit.

"""What a ``win-cuda`` worker can prove about where its work ran. Currently: nothing.

Every other route in this table earns its placement from a *record the runtime
writes while the graph runs*: onnxruntime reports per-node provider assignments,
and ``torch-directml`` reports the device of the output tensor. M3 made that a
hard admission condition after a VitisAI session listed its EP, took **zero**
nodes, and returned output bit-identical to the CPU's -- so neither the provider
list nor the numbers can tell a real device run from a silent fallback.

**vLLM has no analogue.** It does not emit a per-operation device map, and the
cheap substitutes are exactly the ones M3 proved worthless: ``current_platform``
is a *selection*, not an observation; allocated VRAM says weights are resident,
not that the decode step ran on them; and plausible output is what a silent CPU
fallback also produces.

``None`` therefore means *unverified*, which
:func:`vllm_omni.edge.local.external.stage` already refuses with
``REFUSE_EP_PLACEMENT`` -- the same answer the NPU gets when it has not been
measured. Refusing our own engine on the rule we wrote for a vendor's is the
point: the rule is about evidence, not about whose code it is.

To make this route admissible, give it a *measured* device attribution -- a
worker that runs a marked op under a profiler and reports where it landed -- and
set this to that fraction. Do not set it to 1.0 because the code looks right.
