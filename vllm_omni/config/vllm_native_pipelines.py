"""Pipelines for text models vLLM already implements and Omni does not own.

Every other pipeline in the registry sits next to an Omni model definition, in
``vllm_omni/model_executor/models/<name>/pipeline.py``. These have no such
directory, because there is no Omni model to put there: the model executor is
vLLM's, and all that is missing is the one thing vLLM has no concept of -- how
many stages the pipeline has and what they produce.

That gap is worth naming, because it is not obvious from either side. A model
being in vLLM's registry does not make it reachable through ``Omni(model=...)``:
the orchestrator resolves a pipeline by ``model_type`` first, and a
``model_type`` with no entry here fails before any weight is read. Spark-X2.5
hit exactly this in M0 -- its model definition had been registered for a while
and ``Omni(model=<checkpoint>)`` still could not resolve it.

**One stage, and the model_type is the key.** These are autoregressive vLLM
models with a single stage that owns the tokenizer and emits text.
Because the registry is keyed on ``model_type`` rather than on a checkpoint,
registering ``llama`` covers every checkpoint whose config says ``llama`` -- not
only the one this was added for. That is the correct granularity (the pipeline
shape really is a property of the architecture, not of the weights), but it
should be read as what it is: a claim about the *shape* of the pipeline, not a
statement that any particular checkpoint has been run and verified. What has
actually been run is recorded in ``analysis/experiments/``.
